Users can set an alarm by choosing the desired time using drop-down menus for hours, minutes, and seconds. The program then runs in the background, continuously checking the current time against the set alarm time. When the alarm time is reached, the program triggers a sound notification and displays a message on the GUI. The modern design, coupled with easy-to-use functionalities, makes this Alarm Clock a user-friendly tool for setting and managing alarms.
